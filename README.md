### Overview

The main goal of this project is to design and build an end-to-end data engineering pipeline to solve [World Hunger] by ingesting, processing, and transforming data from a source system into a relational database and migrating it to a cloud data warehouse, all while implementing batch and stream processing pipelines and integrating with both SQL and NoSQL databases.

### Tools and Technologies

-   **Data Ingestion and Cleaning**: Python, Pandas, Numpy.
-   **Database**: PostgreSQL, Databricks.
-   **Data Processing**: Apache Spark, Apache Kafka.
-   **Pipeline Management**: Apache Airflow.
-   **NoSQL Database**: ElasticSearch.
-   **Cloud Platform**: Databricks.
-   **Data Migration**: Postgres to Databricks, Postgres to NoSQL.
-   **Production Iac**: Terraform and Azure Databricks 

### Features

-   **Scalability**: Designed to handle large-scale data processing with ease.
-   **Fault Tolerance**: Ensures data integrity and availability even in the event of failures.
-   **Real-Time Processing**: Combines batch processing with real-time data streams for up-to-date results.
-   **Flexible Architecture**: Modular components that can be easily replaced or upgraded.

### Project Structure

1.  **Data Ingestion & Cleaning**:

    - Source: Obtain datasets from Kaggle or other sources (CSV, APIs, etc.).
    - Ingestion: Use Apache Spark in Databricks to ingest data from multiple formats (CSV, API, NoSQL).
    - Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:
    - Clean and preprocess the data using Spark in Databricks.
    - Store cleaned, structured data in PostgreSQL for SQL querying and analysis.
    - If necessary, store unstructured/semi-structured data in Elasticsearch for search and indexing in later phases.


2.  **ETL Pipeline with Airflow**:

    - Set up Apache Airflow to orchestrate ETL jobs, automating the data flow between ingestion, transformation, and storage.
    - Core data transformations will happen using Apache Spark jobs in Databricks.
    -  Migrate transformed, structured data into PostgreSQL for relational analysis and reporting.
    - Optionally, store specific semi-structured/unstructured data in Elasticsearch for search and analytics (for real-time data).

3.  **Data Processing (Batch and Stream)**:

    - Batch Processing: Utilize Apache Spark in Databricks for cleaning, transforming, and processing data in batch jobs.
    - Streaming: If needed, set up Apache Kafka for real-time streaming data ingestion.
       - Kafka â†’ Elasticsearch: Stream real-time data (e.g., logs, sensor data) directly to Elasticsearch for fast indexing, enabling immediate search and analysis.

4.  **NoSQL Data Integration with Elasticsearch**:

    - Store unstructured and semi-structured data (e.g., logs, JSON data, clickstreams) in Elasticsearch.
    - Query Elasticsearch using its robust search features (text search, aggregation, filtering).
    - Use Kibana to create real-time dashboards and visualizations based on the data stored in Elasticsearch.
    - Justification: Elasticsearch is particularly suited for log analysis, real-time data exploration, and high-performance search over large datasets.. 

5.  **Data Lakehouse with Databricks**:
    - Use Databricks Delta Lake for managing both structured and semi-structured data in a data lakehouse architecture.
    - Delta Lake offers ACID transactions and scalability, serving as an intermediate data store for large-scale data transformations before pushing to PostgreSQL or Elasticsearch.

6.  **Production Iac**
    Once the data pipeline and processing components are built, implement IaC to automate infrastructure setup, ensuring smooth and scalable deployments.

    **Provision Databricks Cluster:**

    -   Use Terraform or CloudFormation to automate Databricks cluster deployment.
    -   Define cluster settings (autoscaling, instance types, networking) in code.
    -   Automate the connection between Databricks and your storage (S3, ADLS, etc.).

    **Automate PostgreSQL Setup:**

    -   Use Terraform or Ansible to provision and configure PostgreSQL.
    -   Define security settings (VPC, subnets, security groups, backups).
    -   Set up automatic scaling and replication for load handling.

    **Set Up Apache Airflow:**

    -   Automate Airflow deployment with Terraform or containerize it with Kubernetes.
    -   Enable automatic scheduling, logging, and monitoring.

    **Configure Elasticsearch & Kibana:**

    -   Use Terraform to provision Elasticsearch and Kibana for real-time data visualization.
    -   Define clusters, scaling policies, and storage configurations.

    **Kafka Setup (if needed):**

    -   Use IaC to automate Apache Kafka cluster setup for real-time streaming.
    -   Automate topic creation and producer/consumer configuration.

    **Monitoring & Logging:**

    -   Automate deployment of tools like Prometheus or Grafana for system health monitoring.
    -   Define logging and alerting strategies.

    **Containerization (Optional):**

    -   If using containers, define Docker images and use Terraform to provision Kubernetes clusters.

    **CI/CD Pipeline:**

    -   Set up CI/CD to automate deployment of code, infrastructure, and configuration updates.

### Reflect and Learnings

- Gained hands-on experience with the entire lifecycle of data engineering: ingestion, transformation, pipeline building, and data processing.
- Familiarity with multiple databases (PostgreSQL, Databricks, NoSQL) and the specific challenges of migrating data between them.
- Improved proficiency in batch and stream data processing using tools like Apache Kafka and Apache Spark.
- Learned to automate workflows and pipeline scheduling with Apache Airflow.

### Future Work

- **Advanced Streaming Architectures**: Implement more advanced streaming use cases with real-time data pipelines using Apache Kafka.   
- **Data Lake Integration**: Integrate with a cloud data lake for large-scale data storage and processing.
- **Machine Learning Pipelines**: Use the processed data to feed into machine learning models.
- **Advanced Data Modeling**: Implement more complex schema designs in Databricks or PostgreSQL.
- **Cloud Infrastructure**: Deploy the entire pipeline on a cloud platform like AWS, GCP, or Azure.
