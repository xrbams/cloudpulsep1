### Project Structure

1.  **Data Ingestion & Cleaning**:

    - Source: Obtain datasets from Kaggle or other sources (CSV, APIs, etc.).
    - Ingestion: Use Apache Spark in Databricks to ingest data from multiple formats (CSV, API, NoSQL).
    - Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:
    - Clean and preprocess the data using Spark in Databricks.
    - Store cleaned, structured data in PostgreSQL for SQL querying and analysis.
    - If necessary, store unstructured/semi-structured data in Elasticsearch for search and indexing in later phases.


2.  **ETL Pipeline with Airflow**:

    - Set up Apache Airflow to orchestrate ETL jobs, automating the data flow between ingestion, transformation, and storage.
    - Core data transformations will happen using Apache Spark jobs in Databricks.
    -  Migrate transformed, structured data into PostgreSQL for relational analysis and reporting.
    - Optionally, store specific semi-structured/unstructured data in Elasticsearch for search and analytics (for real-time data).

3.  **Data Processing (Batch and Stream)**:

    - Batch Processing: Utilize Apache Spark in Databricks for cleaning, transforming, and processing data in batch jobs.
    - Streaming: If needed, set up Apache Kafka for real-time streaming data ingestion.
       - Kafka â†’ Elasticsearch: Stream real-time data (e.g., logs, sensor data) directly to Elasticsearch for fast indexing, enabling immediate search and analysis.

4.  **NoSQL Data Integration with Elasticsearch**:

    - Store unstructured and semi-structured data (e.g., logs, JSON data, clickstreams) in Elasticsearch.
    - Query Elasticsearch using its robust search features (text search, aggregation, filtering).
    - Use Kibana to create real-time dashboards and visualizations based on the data stored in Elasticsearch.
    - Justification: Elasticsearch is particularly suited for log analysis, real-time data exploration, and high-performance search over large datasets.. 

5.  **Data Lakehouse with Databricks**:
    - Use Databricks Delta Lake for managing both structured and semi-structured data in a data lakehouse architecture.
    - Delta Lake offers ACID transactions and scalability, serving as an intermediate data store for large-scale data transformations before pushing to PostgreSQL or Elasticsearch.

6.  **Production Iac**
    Once the data pipeline and processing components are built, implement IaC to automate infrastructure setup, ensuring smooth and scalable deployments.

    **Provision Databricks Cluster:**

    -   Use Terraform or CloudFormation to automate Databricks cluster deployment.
    -   Define cluster settings (autoscaling, instance types, networking) in code.
    -   Automate the connection between Databricks and your storage (S3, ADLS, etc.).

    **Automate PostgreSQL Setup:**

    -   Use Terraform or Ansible to provision and configure PostgreSQL.
    -   Define security settings (VPC, subnets, security groups, backups).
    -   Set up automatic scaling and replication for load handling.

    **Set Up Apache Airflow:**

    -   Automate Airflow deployment with Terraform or containerize it with Kubernetes.
    -   Enable automatic scheduling, logging, and monitoring.

    **Configure Elasticsearch & Kibana:**

    -   Use Terraform to provision Elasticsearch and Kibana for real-time data visualization.
    -   Define clusters, scaling policies, and storage configurations.

    **Kafka Setup (if needed):**

    -   Use IaC to automate Apache Kafka cluster setup for real-time streaming.
    -   Automate topic creation and producer/consumer configuration.

    **Monitoring & Logging:**

    -   Automate deployment of tools like Prometheus or Grafana for system health monitoring.
    -   Define logging and alerting strategies.

    **Containerization (Optional):**

    -   If using containers, define Docker images and use Terraform to provision Kubernetes clusters.

    **CI/CD Pipeline:**

    -   Set up CI/CD to automate deployment of code, infrastructure, and configuration updates.
